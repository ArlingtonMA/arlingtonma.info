					<h3>OSAF Mission</h3>
						<ol class="content">
							<li>Create and gain wide adoption of open source application software of uncompromising quality.
							<li>Carry forward the vision of Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart, and Ted Nelson of the computer as a medium for communication, collaboration, and coordination.
							<li>Design a new application to manage personal information including notes, mail, tasks, appointments and events, contacts, documents and other personal resources.
							<li>Enable sharing with colleagues, friends and family. In particular, meet the unique and under-served needs of small group collaboration.
							<li>Demonstrate that open source software *can* serve a general audience in the consumer market.
							<li>Offer a choice of platforms and full interoperability amongst Windows, Macintosh, and Linux versions, for those wondering <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com">how do you start a blog</a> or <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/make-a-website">how to make website</a> using open source solutions.
							
							<li>Leverage our resources by using an open source model of development.
