This is a growing metadata collection of non-profit, locally-focused news organizations.  As an open source project, we've only listed news sites that we've been able to easily find, quantify, and detect an EIN or federal tax ID for, which ensures they are 501(c)3 nonprofits.  More submissions are welcome!
