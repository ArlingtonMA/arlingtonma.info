Arlington's hometown news site [Your Arlington](https://yourarlington.com/about) has recently transitioned to be a non-profit organization, and is joining many local news nonprofits across Massachusetts and the US.  To help with strategy planning for Your Arlington, we've built a metadata catalog of other hyperlocal news sites in MA, along with analyzed some nonprofit financials.

Other key data sources include demographics from [MA Department of Local Services data](https://www.mass.gov/collections/DLS-databank-reports?topicid=91821), and the most excellent [Nonprofit Explorer and API from Propublica](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/).

Current datasets - and we are always [looking for submissions](/help)!
