## Town Expenses By Department

A comparison of annual (2019) expenses by department between Arlington and selected local towns.  We should update this page to better allow people to compare to different local comparable towns as defined in the annual report.  Note that the data for department spending in these charts may differ subtly between towns (by small amounts, proportionally) due to how different towns classify expenses per department in their top-level reporting to the state.

For example, depending on the town, costs for Crossing Guards may be in the Education budget, or another public safety budget category.

## Police Staffing Per Capita

NOTE: this data is not cross-checked, so is only an approximation.  Some towns do not easily post their staffing levels, and some towns may have subtly different classifications between staff, sworn officers, and patrol officers.
