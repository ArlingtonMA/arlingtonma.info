The town of Arlington has updated both their website and data catalogs in 2022, so care should be taken to check if you're using the latest links or data from town sources.

## Town Website And Assessor Database Updates

In 2020, [Arlington updated the town website system](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10556/2654?arch=1%2c1&cftype=News) with new software from Granicus.  This featured enhanced ADA compliance, better navigation, as well as some better display of meeting agendas.  While most old links are redirected, some links from before 2020 may not work; please let us know if you see broken links here.

At the end of 2022, Arlington replaced the property lookup tool with a [new assessor database lookup tool](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/12812/16?backlist=%2fdepartments%2ffinance%2fassessor), as covered in this [Your Arlington article](https://www.yourarlington.com/?view=article&id=21080:assess-010223&catid=31).  You can now [lookup property assessment and tax records](https://arlington.patriotproperties.com/default.asp), as well as see [newly digitized assessor maps](https://www.mapsonline.net/arlingtonma/assessor.html).
